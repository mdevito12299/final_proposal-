sorry i have 2 i couldnt decide 
# final_proposal-1 (mostly done in p5) 

Christmas in Code 

Summary: 
I have chosen to make Christmas animation with snow, Santa flying, and presents falling from the sleigh.

I have decided to make the piece interactive by having presents fall every time the mouse is clicked, and each time the animation is reloaded a different Christmas song will play in a soft piano version. I think the most challenging part will be the Santa flying and the snow falling. I will build my project mainly using javascript in p5 and loading up music from the internet. 

Challenges: 
    - I think having Santa fly and wave, having a present fall each time the mouse is clicked and making sure each song was different, using the array  will be challenging to do. 

Timeline: 
    - Week 1: write proposal 
    - Week 2: figure out motions of project, working on the array, and flying from one side to the other and looping back around 
    - Week 3: the snow falling and finding the music, making the presents fall 
    - Week 4: adjust the music and make sure the code can run without issues
    - Week 5: present

Final Proposal idea 2 (using the ardunio- possibly?) 

Chirstmas but you can see real lights not just code 

Summary: 
My idea for this code is to have LED lights attached to the ardunio that will light up in sync with a christmas song that will be playing from the computer. These lights will be in a pattern in tune with the song.   

Components: 
An output device (mainly a computer) 
A censor (input) 
Ardunio board

Challenges: 
I anticipate getting the lights to work alongside the music will be the most challenging part, and I will have to figure out each speed of the lights in tune with the chosen song. I have found some references to use in case things become complicated. 


Timeline: 
Week 1: proposal & finding multiple reference videos to work with 
Week 2: build the basics of the code to make sure a simple light will work 
Week 3: time out the music and figure out when each light would need to go off 
Week 4: test and make sure each light works and the code is working properly 
Week 5: present
