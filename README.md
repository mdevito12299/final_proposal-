# final_proposal-1 (mostly done in p5) 

Christmas in Code 

Summary: 
I have chosen to make Christmas animation with snow, Santa flying, and presents falling from the sleigh.

I have decided to make the piece interactive by having presents fall every time the mouse is clicked, and each time the animation is reloaded a different Christmas song will play in a soft piano version. I think the most challenging part will be the Santa flying and the snow falling. I will build my project mainly using javascript in p5 and loading up music from the internet. 

Challenges: 
    - I think having Santa fly and wave, having a present fall each time the mouse is clicked and making sure each song was different, using the array  will be challenging to do. 

Timeline: 
    - Week 1: write proposal 
    - Week 2: figure out motions of project, working on the array, and flying from one side to the other and looping back around 
    - Week 3: the snow falling and finding the music, making the presents fall 
    - Week 4: adjust the music and make sure the code can run without issues
    - Week 5: present
